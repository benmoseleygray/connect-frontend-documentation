# gPoll Overview

Alert: The on-air feature is only available for stations with a Full Viz RT graphics system.
Alert: An alternative to the on-air feature if you do not have a Full Viz RT graphics system is to use a computer and monitor you have hooked into your production system.

## Linking Poll from Web

## Points of Note

*Please make sure to double check your work before making the poll active.* Making a poll question "Active" will automatically make it live on your website. 

*The on-air portion of this module, which auto updates on-air, is only available for stations with a full Viz graphics system.* It is not available for Chyron or Xpression stations at this time.

You can find the gPoll L3RD graphic in the Gray Gpoll Concept in iNews or ENPS.

To see an example of the L3RD on-air please [view this video:](https://d2pvyxdw30n8fd.cloudfront.net/GDM/v5ab11d30180f3/GPOLL.mp4)

We have a fullscreen available. If your station is interested in using it you can [submit a graphics request](https://graphics.gray.tv/index.php?page=gray-graphics-order-form) so that Graphics can make one that will match their current graphics look.
